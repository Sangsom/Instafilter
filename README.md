# Instafilter

App is created by following Hacking by Swift book by Paul Hudson.

As an challenge exercises I've implemented following features:

- Making a save button show error in case if there was no image in the image view.
- Making the Change Filter button change it's title to show the name of the currently selected filter.
- Added one more slider for controlling radius effect.
